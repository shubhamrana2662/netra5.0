"""
CyberDrishti AI — Cognitive Forensic Intelligence Engine Package

Self-contained, dependency-light (pure Python stdlib) cognitive
subsystem comprising 11 autonomous analytical engines for advanced
cyber crime investigation.

Each engine is a standalone module with zero database coupling —
they accept dicts/lists and return structured results.  Integration
with the FastAPI request layer lives in routes/cognitive.py.
